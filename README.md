The complete W3schools Django Tutorial cannot be directly completed in Spaces - W3schools.
This follows the W3schools Django Tutorial:  https://www.w3schools.com/django/index.php
And includes the following steps:
  Django Create Project
  Django Create App
  Django Views
  Django URLs
  Django Templates

I will create a follow-up project that will include connecting the to the Spaces - W3schools database
and complete the tutorial.
